In this assignment, I designed a sequential convolutional model in Python using the Keras API and other relevant libraries to classify the CIFAR-100 dataset. CIFAR-100 consists of 60000 32x32 images in 100 classes, with 600 images in each. The goal was to understand the process of processing and formatting data to be trained, create a model with as high accuracy as possible, train the model, evaluating its performance, and visualizing the results.
